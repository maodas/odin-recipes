    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Thai cuisine is one of contrasts and Thai beef salad is a perfect example. <br>
        In the dressing alone, sweet meets salty, spicy and sour and in the salad intense chilli meets gentle aromatic herbs and cooling cucumber, all coming together in perfect harmony. </p>
