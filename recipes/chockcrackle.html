    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>75g white marshmallows </li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp thickened cream </li>
        <li>100g (2 cups) Kellogg's Coco Pops</li>
        <li>6 x 42g pkts Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, paper cases removed </li>
        <li>200g CADBURY Baking Dark Chocolate Melts </li>
        <li>Sea salt flakes, to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the marshmallows and cream in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly, for 2-3 minutes or until the mixture is smooth and well combined. <br>
            Set aside for 2 minutes to cool slightly. </li>
        <li>Place the Coco Pops in a large bowl. 
            Add the marshmallow mixture and stir until the Coco Pops are well coated. </li>
        <li>Lightly grease twelve 40ml patty pans with oil spray. Place a Peanut Butter Cup in the base of each pan. Using 2 spoons, place the Coco Pop mixture on top, then use slightly wet hands to press down gently to compact. <br>
            Place in the fridge to set. </li>
        <li>Remove the choc-crackle cups from the pans and place on a wire rack. </li>
        <li>Place the dark chocolate melts in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on Medium, stirring every 30 seconds, for 2-3 minutes, until the chocolate is melted and smooth.</li>
